From [@guibom](https://github.com/guibom): This JMB362 is an older JMicron card and controller, but it works really well. No need for custom drivers or settings, it worked out-of-box with the latest kernel. Seems like a good solution for somebody that needs only 2 drives, and doesn't want to modify their 1x PCIe slot.

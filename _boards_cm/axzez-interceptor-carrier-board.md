Axzez's Interceptor CM4 Carrier Board has:

- 2 HDMI ports (4Kp60)
- 5 SATA ports (via JMicron JMB585)
- 4 RJ-45 gigabit ports (via managed RTL8367RB gigabit switch)
- 4 USB 2.0 ports (2 via pin header)
- RS-485
- 24-pin ATX power supply connector
- RTC clock with battery backup
- 4 3-pin fan connectors
- 8-pin header for system power LED, power button and UART serial cable
- Two FFC connectors (40 pos) for future expansion

It seems ideal for DVR or network storage applications, and the FFC connectors may enable some interesting new use cases in the future.

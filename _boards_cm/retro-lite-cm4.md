The Retro Lite CM4 is a sleek, handheld gaming console based around the Compute Module 4. It is a collaboration project between StonedEdge and Dmcke5 [on the BitBuilt forums](https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?threads/retro-lite-cm4-a-stonededge-and-dmcke5-collaboration.3934/). It is modelled in SolidWorks and the PCBs were designed in EAGLE. The final shell is machined 6061 aluminum.

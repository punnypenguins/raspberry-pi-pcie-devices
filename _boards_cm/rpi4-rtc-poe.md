The [RPi4-RTC-PoE](https://ab-log.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=1895) from ab-log is a DIN rail mini server offers PoE power, Gigabit Ethernet, USB 2.0, USB-over-Ethernet, an M.2 2230 slot for NVMe SSDs, a power button, status LEDs, an RTC, hardware watchdog, RS485, and ZigBee, and is a very compact little DIN server.

> Note: The server [used to be available on Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/megad-2561/rpi4-rtc-poe/) but is no longer, due to Siemens' restrictions against listing Russian sellers on Tindie. So for now, until Russia ends the war in Ukraine, this product will likely not be available to the western world.

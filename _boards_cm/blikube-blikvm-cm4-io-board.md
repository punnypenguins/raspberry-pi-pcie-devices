The [BliKVM CM4 IO Board for Pi-KVM](https://github.com/ThomasVon2021/pikvm-CM4-Board) is currently [available through AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003262886521.html?spm=a2g0o.store_pc_allProduct.8148356.5.39cd62bejpZaWF)).

The BliKVM integrates Pi-KVM v3 features into a compact Compute Module 4-based board that fits in an even smaller space, and doesn't require as complicated an assembly process. The board can be bought standalone, or in a kit with a case, fan, and OLED display.

This 4x SATA NAS board by [Wiretrustee](https://wiretrustee.com) has an integrated Marvell 88SE9215 controller on the PCIe bus to interface with up to 4 native SATA ports.

The was originally going to be made available [through Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee-sata) in 2021 with 2.5" and 3.5" hard drive enclosures, but the project was discontinued due to global parts supply shortages affecting production schedules.

The [Wiretrustee SATA GitHub repository](https://github.com/wiretrustee/cm4-sata-board) should contain open source files for the SATA board and enclosure.
